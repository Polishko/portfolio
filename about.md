Hi, Iâ€™m Niya! ðŸ‘‹
My friends also call me Nalan.

âœ¨ I'm a Localization Professional with an academic background in Environmental Science and Engineering.
I was recently inspired to pursue a long-time dream of learning programming. It has since become a dream come true, and Iâ€™ve been enjoying every moment!

Iâ€™ve completed the Software Engineering â€“ Python learning path at SoftUni.

Currently, Iâ€™m deepening my Front-End skills, with a focus on JavaScript, React, and TypeScript.

Iâ€™m passionate about building responsive web applications and writing clean, maintainable code.

I enjoy understanding how things work under the hood â€” from programming fundamentals to real-world project structure.

ðŸ§° Languages and Tools:
Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, PostgreSQL, React, Django, Git
